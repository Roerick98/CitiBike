# CitiBike Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to construct and demonstrate visualizations on CitiBike data to investors with the purpose of convincing them to fund a new bike-share company in Des-Moines. Using Jupyter Notebooks, I was able to perfrom a data type cast on a single column and exported the dataframe as a new csv file. I then uploaded this new comma separated value file into Tableau to construct visualizations of trends for the bike-share data. 
## Results
The first goal was to analyze the average time most bikes were rented for.<br /> ![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35403433/135785635-9013257a-23d4-44ea-81ac-adb0c2af0cd9.png) <br /> As you can see, most checkout times for bikes consisted of around 5 minutes, allowing for outliers that consisted of over one or even two hour checkout times. <br />
<br />
The next goal on the agenda was to assess whether or not gender affected bike-ride durations.<br /> ![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35403433/135785955-9f845fbe-de9c-4cf2-8497-a1d55fcc81a6.png) <br /> From this graph we can see that although there are a good amount of unknown data points with regard to gender, generally males dominate the bike-share industry. The mean ride duration for men was approximately five minutes while the mean duration for women was approximately six. However, bikes were checked out at almost three times the rate for men than for women. <br />
<br />
Hourly rates were also visualized to assess which times would be best to perform repairs. <br /> ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35403433/135787083-71b838aa-14be-41c0-ae9f-f86ca29f5ea5.png) <br /> It appears that the best time to perform any repairs would be during the hours of 12 AM to 5AM every day of the week. <br />
<br />
Performing the same analysis but filtering gender was also of interest to identify any patterns unusual patterns that differed between men and women. ![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35403433/135787613-ae8ddcdd-e792-4291-bf1a-4dc1a514ef17.png)<br />
As you can see, there aren't any notable differences in male and female weekly bike checkouts. Other than the noticeable difference in number of checkouts for males, both men and women follow a similar weekly riding pattern. However, something to note is the fact that we see an uptake in unknown data points in regard to gender during the weekends. This could possibly be due to a general increase in rides during these times. <br />
<br />
Another area of interest is the type of customer and thus which group of people the company should market itself to the most. For instance, the Citi Bike data provides two types of customers, those who either obtain one day or three day passes or those who obtain an annual subscription plan.<br /> ![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35403433/135788277-78988e0e-7436-4641-b192-4610de343c63.png) <br /> As it turns out, the vast majority of riders possess an annual subscription to the bike-share service. This could potentially be due to people opting to ride a bike to work instead of driving a car. Thus, these people would probably obtain an annual subscription, rather than having to obtain passes every couple of days. <br />
<br />
Finally, the last two areas of interest to visualize are the starting and ending locations for rides. Monitoring starting and ending locations could assist the company with predicting which type of locations acquire more business.<br /> ![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35403433/135788743-ba9163c5-6def-4245-9804-e16eaa8edb79.png)<br />
![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35403433/135788779-6f1f3bef-b5ae-4daa-84ba-ef1b41b6651b.png) <br /> As one would expect, the city outperformed the surrounding area by a longshot. Suburban areas contained a small amount of activity, with instances of rides evenly distributed throughout the area.
## Summary
In conclusion the density of rides was much higher in the city than the surrounding area. When leveraged with providing repair times during early mornings rather than later in the day, marketing to males could prove to be a great benefit to the company. It is evident that men comprise a vast amount of the company's business.  Also, two additional analysis that could prove to be beneficial might be a visualization of female dominant areas and patterns with speed variations. Marketing to females could be a great success for CitiBike, as only a small amount of women currently use the service when compared with men. Finally, analyzing trends in speed could lead to the inorporation of hourly rates.
